Version updates:
0.13 - all documentation ok
     - no Topic Models
     - no examples

0.14 - scripts for runMarkovChainNoRegenS, runMarkovChainRegenS,
       coeffVar, computeCI, *HLMM functions can be found in demo directory.
       They can be called with demo(demo1) and demo(demo2) and demo(demo3).
       Do demo() to get a description of each demonstration script.

0.15 - scripts for runMarkovChainNoRegenS, runMarkovChainRegenS,
       coeffVar, computeCI, *HLMM functions can be found in demo/ directory.
       They can be called with demo(demo1) and demo(demo2) and demo(HLMMdemo).
       Do demo() to get a description of each demonstration script.
     - inst/ directory contains scripts for running petrol data, in S and P.
     - inst/ directory also contains Rprofile for batch jobs
     - contains timing code for runMarkovChainRegenP
     - old regenProbs() moved to regenProbsFromRawOutput()
     - new regenProbs() function that allows user to bypass smallFn, 
       smallMeasure, and transDens.
     - always use NAMED ARGUMENTS!

0.16 - Topic Model functions and demo

0.19 - Includes A. Tan's improper priors model. Parametrization is in 
       terms of sigma and not lamda for the variance components
     - includes demo script (demo3) and runBatchParallel that 
       demonstrates how to run interactively and in batch mode.
     - oh yes.. includes interactive sessions now.

REMINDERS:

(1) Are you using the right .Rprofile file? (BOTH)
(2) Did you remember to load the McParre library with lib.loc argument (BATCH)
(3) Did you remember to put mpi.quit()? (BOTH)
(4) Did you remember to close the slaves with dellog=FALSE? (INTERACTIVE)
